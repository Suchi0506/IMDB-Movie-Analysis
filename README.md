In this project, I have the data for the 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online. In this assignment, I tried to find some interesting insights into these movies and their voters, using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
